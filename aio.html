</h1>
<p><strong>Reproducibility</strong> <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current" class="external-link">according
to the ACM</a> means: the ability to obtain a measurement with stated
precision by a different team using the same measurement procedure, the
same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same
or a different location on multiple trials.</p>
<p>This definition derives from <em>metrology</em>, the science of
measuring, and we will specialize some of the terms “measurement”,
“measurement procedure”, and “operating conditions” in software context
for computational science experiments (from here on,
<strong>CSEs</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Measurement procedure (for CSEs)</strong>: the application
code and user-interactions required to run the application code (if
any).</p>
<p><strong>Operating conditions (for CSEs)</strong>: a set of conditions
the computer system must implement in order to run a certain program.
E.g., a POSIX environment, GCC 12 compiled in <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>
with these flags.</p>
<p>For every CSE, there are probably some operating conditions in which
it is the measurement can be made. To make our definition not vacuous,
“reproducibility” will require all relevant operating conditions have to
be documented (e.g., “README.md states you must have GCC 12 in
<code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>”). Operating conditions can be eliminated by
moving them to the measurement procedure (e.g., the program itself
contains a copy of GCC 12). For the purposes of this lesson, the
operating conditions are the “manual” steps that the user has to take in
order to use the measurement procedure to make the measurement. One may
over-specify operating conditions without changing the reproducibility
status (e.g., one might say their software requires GCC 12, but really
GCC 13 would work); it is quite difficult and often not necessary to
know the minimal set of operating conditions, so in practice, we usually
have an larger-than-necessary set of operating conditions.</p>
<p>Often in UNIX-like systems, the only relevant conditions are certain
objects be on certain “load paths”, specified by environment variables.
E.g., have Python 3.11 in <code>$PATH</code>, have Numpy 1.26 in
<code>$PYTHONPATH</code>, and have a BLAS library in
<code>$LIBRARY_PATH</code>. In such cases, it doesn’t matter where those
programs are on disk; the only relevant “operating condition” is that
the environment variables are set to point to those programs at a
compatible version.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement (for CSEs)</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crash-freedom: program produces result without crashing.</li>
<li>Bitwise equivalence: output files and streams are identical.</li>
<li>Statistical equivalence: overlapping confidence intervals, etc.</li>
<li>Inferential equivalence: whether the inference is supported by the
output.</li>
<li>Others: domain-specific measurements/equivalences (e.g.,
XML-equivalence ignores order of attribtues)</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it is difficult to find a measurement that is both easy
to assess and scientifically meaningful.</p>

<p>We explicitly define reproducibility because not everyone uses the
ACM definition. <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/" class="external-link">Reproducible
Builds</a> and <a href="https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch14.html#hermeticcomma_reproduciblecomma_or_veri" class="external-link">Google’s
Building Secure and Reliable Systems</a> uses bit-wise equivalence only.
Operating on different definitions without realizing it leads to <a href="https://linderud.dev/blog/nixos-is-not-reproducible/" class="external-link">disagreements</a>.
Defining reproducibility with respect to a measurement and operating
conditions is more useful; one can refer to different kinds and degrees
of reproducibility in different conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Composition of measurement procedures</strong>: The outcome
of one measurement may be the input to another measurement procedure.
This can happen in CSEs as well as in physical experiments. In physical
experiments, one may use a device to calibrate (measure) some other
device, and use that other device to measure some scientific phenomenon.
Likewise, In CSE, the output of compilation may be used as the input to
another CSE. One can measure a number of relevant properties of the
result of a software compilation.</p>

<p>E.g., suppose one runs <code>gcc main.c</code> on two systems and one
system uses a different version of <code>unistd.h</code>, which is
<code>#included</code> by <code>main.c</code>. The process (running
<code>gcc main.c</code>) does not reproduce source-equivalent binaries,
but it might reproduce behavior-equivalent binaries or bit-wise
equivalent binaries (depending on how different
<code>unistd.h</code>).</p>

similar to reproducibility, with the only difference whether the team is
the same or different than the original and whether the measurement

<p>Replicability is of course the goal of scientific experiments,
because the measurement can be made in different ways but still give
consistent results. However, replicability involves re-doing some or all
of the work, so it is expensive to pursue in practice. Therefore, we
examine repeatability and reproducibility instead.</p>
<p><strong>Computational provenance</strong> is a record of the process
by which a particular computational artifact was generated
(<strong>retrospective</strong>) or could potentially be generated
(<strong>prospective</strong>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Provenance of a final artifact may include
the provenance of the artifacts used by the final process, and so on,
the artifacts used to generate the artifacts used to generate (and so
on…) the final artifact.</p>
<p>Provenance is related to reproducibility because sufficiently
detailed provenance (prospective or retrospective) may allow other users
to reproduce the process within some equivalence.</p>
<p>Although there are many definitions of <strong>computational
workflows</strong>, the most related definition is a program written in
a language that explicitly represents a loosely-coupled, coarse-grained
dataflow graph. “Loosely-coupled” and “coarse-grained” has some wiggle
room, but usually each node represents an isolated process or container
and the edges are usually files or parameters, for example, GNU Make and
<a href="https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link">Snakemake</a>.
Workflows improve reproducibility by automating manual commands thereby
documenting the measurement procedure for others. Often workflows are
the alternative to projects which previously run a pile of scripts in a
specific order known only to the developers. Workflows can be seen as a
form prospective provenance and workflow engines are a natural place to
emit prospective and retrospective provenance. Workflows are not
necessary for reproducibility, so long as the relevant measurement
procedure is otherwise documented or automated, and they are sufficient
only when the workflow language is sufficiently detailed (i.e., detailed
enough to capture all of the relevant operating conditions).</p>
<p><strong>Literate programming</strong> is a medium where a program’s
source code is embedded in an explanation of how it works<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. Systems that
facilitating literate programming (from here on, <strong>literate
programming systems</strong>) often also permit the user to execute
snippets of their code and embed the result automatically in a report.
Programs written in literate programming systems with cell execution
used in data science are sometimes called “notebooks”, due to their
resemblance to a lab notebook. <a href="https://jupyter.org/" class="external-link">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/" class="external-link">Knitr</a>, and <a href="https://quarto.org/" class="external-link">Quarto</a> are examples of literate
programming system with cell execution. These are often discussed in the
context of reproducibility (See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/515151a" class="external-link">1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-018-07196-1" class="external-link">2</a>, <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781315373461-1/knitr-comprehensive-tool-reproducible-research-yihui-xie" class="external-link">3</a>,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315373461" class="external-link">4</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/9789814749411_0018" class="external-link">5</a>). Like
workflows, notebooks automate procedures that may otherwise be manual
(thereby documenting them for others); they can even contain the output
of the code, so one can verify if their result is the similar to the
authors. Also like workflows, notebooks are not sufficient by themselves
for reproducibility, although they can be a valuable part of a
reproducible artifact; there are often necessary operating conditions
(must have Numpy version 1.26; must have <code>data.csv</code>) that are
documented outside of the notebook or not documented at all. Since
notebooks support cell-execution triggered by a UI element, the cells
can be executed in a manual order, which becomes an undocumented part of
the measurement procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Containers and virtual machines (VMs)</strong> are related to
reproducibility. These will be discussed in depth in a future
episode.</p>

<p>A <strong>package manager</strong> is a program that manages
(installs, upgrades, removes) a given target software and the target’s
software dependencies.</p>
<p>There are several distinguishing features of package managers: 1.
whether they install packages by compiling the packages from source or
downloading binary files 2. whether they attempt to solve dependency 3.
whether they operate on a local or system-wide environment</p>
<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="from-source-or-binary">From-source or binary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-source-or-binary"></a>
</h1>
<p><strong>Binary package managers</strong> install software by
downloading pre-compiled files and placing them in certain paths.</p>
<p><strong>From-source package managers</strong> install software
primarily by downloading source code, compiling it, and placing it in
certain paths. However, from-source package managers may optionally use
a binary cache, where they can download a pre-compiled binary; the
salient difference between from-source with binary cache package
managers and binary-only package managers is that the former can always
“fall back” on compiling the source when the binaries when the cache
can’t be used for an arbitrary reason.</p>
<p>This design choice influences the following qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: downloading pre-compiled binaries is
often faster (assuming the network is fast enough relative to the
slowness of compilation). However binary caches speed up from-source
package managers in common cases<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>: users of binary package managers
implicitly trust the package repository storage/delivery and the
compiler stack of the maintainer who compiled the package in the first
place. However, organizations may audit builds can move trust from the
maintainer to the auditor (which may be the end-user). From-source
package managers implicitly trust the package repository
storage/delivery and compiler stack on the user’s system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: compilation may to include certain
assumptions about the runtime system (e.g., dynamic library RUNPATH) or
certain extensions (e.g., <code>--disable-ipv6</code>). Users of binary
package managers are subject to whatever compile-time options the
maintainer used. They can alleviate this by offering multiple variants
of the binary at greater storage cost. From-source package managers make
it much easier to automatically or manually change compile-time
options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure cost</strong>: binary packages are
expensive to store. A binary is specific to a CPU instruction-set
architecture (ISA) (e.g., x86 64-bit and ARMv8-A), operating system
kernel<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
(e.g., Linux, MacOS, and Windows), and version of the software. Each
package manager has a different binary format, be it DEB for APT, RPM
for YUM/DNF, Wheels for Pip, etc., so reuse between package managers is
rare. Meanwhile, the version-controlled source-code is shared by users
of all CPU ISAs, all OS kernels, all versions<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, and all from-source
package managers<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the most important factor is infrastructure cost.
<strong>Storing binaries for every ISA, OS, and software version is
expensive, so nobody does it for free forever.</strong> For example, APT
depends on volunteers or organizations to host repositories for free but
not forever; <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/" class="external-link">ftp.debian.org</a> has
nothing older than Debian 10.x (2019 – expected 2024) at the time of
writing. Software environments based on Debian 9.x (new in 2017) may not
be reproducible today. The same problems exist for Ubuntu, Fedora,
CentOS, and even multi-platform binary package managers like Conda.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>See caveats about Docker<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>; I will use it here to demonstrate
“starting from a clean install and running one command.”</p>
<pre class="docker"><code>FROM debian:9
RUN apt-get update
# At the time of writing, this Dockerfile will fail at this step.</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, storing the source code is much less expensive,
and Software Heritage committed to storing the source code of important
open-source infrastructure for free for a long time.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Many software projects not only release the source code, they often
allow users to modify the source code. This makes their software more
debuggable, repairable, and extensible; if it breaks, users can fix it
themselves. However, the benefits of open-source are not realized if
there is more friction in installing from source than installing from
binary. Users would have to locate the source code, download it, learn
its build system, find the package manager’s build recipe for it, learn
the package manager’s packaging system, build the binary package, serve
the binary from a package repository, add the repository to their
package managers sources list, and install it. When installing from
binaries is the common-case, installing from source may become neglected
and flaky.</p>
<p>However, the process of compiling software has its own operating
conditions necessary for equivalent-behavior reproducibility<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> (e.g.,
“requires GCC 12”). But who compiles the compiler? The operating
conditions of the package manager itself can be thought of as a “trusted
computing base”.</p>
<p>A <strong>trusted computing base (TCB)</strong> is a term from
computer security for a small set of software that security analysts
assume correctly implements a certain contract, which is usually kept
dead-simple. They develop guarantees of the form “assuming the TCB is
correct to its TCB contract, this high-level software correctly
implements this high-level contract”. Package managers think of TCB as a
small set of software that is “trusted to be reproducible” rather than
“trusted to be secure”. As in computer security, package managers should
strive to keep their TCB as easy to reproduce as possible, either by
making it small or making a good installer that enforces the operating
conditions. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>One may try to pre-compile binary packages for all relevant
platforms, but one simply can’t predict what ISAs their users will have
in the future. The set of popular ISAs is in constant flux: - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium" class="external-link">Itanium</a> (2001 – 2021)
processors are no longer purchasable - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SPARC" class="external-link">SPARC</a> (1987 – 2029
expected) is planned to go that way too - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_ISA" class="external-link">PowerPC</a> (2006) is
exceedingly rare for desktop consumers at the time of writing - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" class="external-link">x86 64-bit</a> (2000) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#64/32-bit_architecture" class="external-link">ARMv8-A</a>
(2011) have soared (for ARM, due to the popularity of the Raspberry Pi
and Apple M-series), with backwards compatibility for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#32-bit_architecture" class="external-link">ARMv7-A</a>
(2007) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86" class="external-link">x86 32-bit</a>
(1985) - But even the hegemony of x86-64 is not certain, given Intel’s
proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64" class="external-link">x86S</a>
(2023).</p>
<p>For these reasons, I suggest using a from-source package manager for
long-term reproducibility.</p>

<h1 id="dependency-constraint-solving-or-not">Dependency Constraint solving or not<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dependency-constraint-solving-or-not"></a>
</h1>
<p>Every package has a <strong>version</strong>, which are ordered in
sequence<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A <strong>dependency constraint</strong> occurs when operating some
versions of A requires operating B (operate usually means compile or
run). Since the packages have multiple versions, each version of A may
depend on having one of a set of versions of B. Some versions of A may
not depend on B at all, but so long as other versions of A do, we will
say A has a dependency constraint on B. Usually, dependency constraints
map a range of versions of A to a range of versions of B, where a range
is an upper- and lower-bound, but there can be . E.g., (Numba 0.58
requires Python at least 3.8 and at most 3.11; Numba 0.55 requires
Python at least 3.7 and at most 3.10; …). If the dependency constraint
is violated, operating the package invokes undefined behavior.</p>
<p>A <strong>Diamond dependency</strong> is a set of packages and
dependency constraints where A depends on B and C, B and C depend on D,
and the user wants to install A<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- TODO: figure -->
<p>A <strong>consistent set</strong> is a mapping from packages to
versions, satisfying dependency constraints.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency constraint solving</strong> is the process of
finding a consistent set. If the user asks for Python and Numba, package
version resolution may select Numba==0.58 and Python==3.11.</p>
<p>Dependency constraint solving for a diamond dependency is
particularly tricky. If one selects a candidate for A (perhaps
defaulting to the latest), and then selects compatible candidates for B
and C. However, those candidate versions of B and C may require
different versions of D. One may try different candidates for B and C
that are compatible with our selected candidate for A, but perhaps none
of these will work. In that case, one has to “backtrack” even further
and select a new candidate for A. A itself may have been the downstream
package of another diamond dependency, so one may have to backtrack on
those candidates, and so on.</p>
<p>In general, dependency constraint solving is NP-complete<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> due to
the necessity of backtracking in diamond dependencies. Oversimplify the
details, NP-completeness means the runtime of the fastest known<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
algorithm scales exponentially<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> with the input.</p>
<p>Dependency constraint solving is often implemented as a call to an
external <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/SAT_solver" class="external-link">boolean
satisfiability (SAT) solver</a>). Since they are used in many problems,
SAT solvers have been optimized for decades; their runtime is still
exponential but a lesser exponential than home-built solutions.</p>
<!-- Slow dependency solving is particularly a pain point for Conda users^[See [conda/conda#7239 on GitHub](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/7239)]. -->
<!-- [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a drop-in replcaement for Conda that uses a faster dependency constraint solver, called [libsolv](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv). -->
<!-- Conda introduced an experimental option to use Mamba's wrapper around libsolv^[See [A Faster Solver for Conda: Libmamba on Anaconda's blog 2016](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community)]. -->
<p>Some package managers attempt to reduce the complexity of solving by
the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reducing the number of candidate versions by using fewer package
repositories (<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/conda-performance.html#set-strict-channel-priority" class="external-link">Conda’s
strict package priority</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@marius.v.niekerk/conda-metachannel-f962241c9437" class="external-link">Conda
meta-channel</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Ordering the candidates such that the correct solve is found
earlier (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/66963979/1078199" class="external-link">reordering Conda
channels</a>).</p></li>
<li>
<p>NodeJS has a notion of “public dependencies” (called “<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies" class="external-link">peer
dependencies</a>” to NodeJS developers) and “private dependencies”
(called “dependencies” to NodeJS developers). Private dependencies don’t
need to be consistent with each other, so the more dependencies that can
be treated as private dependencies rather than public dependencies the
simpler the dependency graph becomes. When B and C privately depend on
D, <code>require("D")</code> from B can loads a different version than
<code>require("D")</code> from C (see <a href="https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2016/08/24/understanding-the-npm-dependency-model/" class="external-link">Understanding
the npm dependency model by King on their blog 2016</a>). However, if
types or global variables from one package end up in the public
interface of another, it has to be a public dependency.</p>
<p>Nix can also make dependencies “private” in some cases. If B and C
require D to be on the <code>$PATH</code>, Nix can replace B with a <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#fun-makeWrapper" class="external-link">wrapper
script</a> that adds a specific version of D to the <code>$PATH</code>
and executes the underlying B program, and likewise for C. No copy of D
needs to be on the global <code>$PATH</code>; the right version of D is
always put on the <code>$PATH</code> “just in time” for execution of B
or C, and the version of D for B does not interfere with the version of
D for C.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Package repositories contain few or only one version of each
package (APT/apt-get). This reduces the number of candidates to search
through. However, the community has to ensure that a the repository
contains a consistent set for every set of packages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, some package managers avoid the package version resolution
altogether using one of the following strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let the user solve dependency constraints themselves (e.g., Pip
before version 20.3). This is only practical when the version
constraints are loose; i.e., the newest version of A will work with any
new-ish version of B.</p></li>
<li><p>Only allow a single version of every package from a
manually-maintained consistent set (e.g., <a href="https://www.stackage.org/" class="external-link">Haskell Stackage</a>).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html" class="external-link">When
Maven encounters a diamond dependency</a>, either B or C, whichever is
closer to the root, gets its preferred version of D and the other
constraint gets ignored. The user often specifies the exact version of D
themselves to ensure correctness.</p></li>

</h1>
<p>Package managers either install to a local or a system-wide software
environment.</p>
<p>System-wide software environment package managers are necessary for
several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hardcoded paths</strong>: Some software uses hardcoded,
unchangeable paths to root-owned directories, for example
<code>/usr/lib</code>. Most software today does not have hardcoded
paths, and so long as their source code is available and licensed for
modifications, it isn’t unchangeable. Nevertheless, this issue was more
important when package managers were designed.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>System-wide effect</strong>: Some software has
system-level effects or uses, e.g., the bootloader, the kernel, drivers,
and login manager are installed using a system-wide package
manager.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Save space</strong>: Historically, disk space was
expensive, so system administrators (sysadmins) did not want users
compiling the same package just for themselves. Rather, the sysadmins
installed one for everyone to a global location upon request.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, local environment package managers have the
following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reduce dependency conflicts</strong>: Suppose project A
have conflicting dependencies with project B (unsatisfiable), but if
they both have their own local environment, this is no bother. Local
environments naturally have fewer packages than their system-wide union,
minimizing the time needed to SAT-solve.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Principle of least privilege</strong>: Normal users can
manage software environments without superuser privilege.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Containers and virtual machines are one way of using system-wide
package managers in a local-environment.</p>

<p><strong>Semantic versioning</strong> (also known as semver) is a
convention for constructing version strings<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. There are many rules,
but the gist is that versions have three numbers separated by dots
(e.g., 1.0.0). Releases that are backwards-incompatible increment the
first number (called the major version), while releases that add new
functionality in a backwards-compatible way increment the second number
(called the minor version), and bug-fix releases increment the third
number (called the patch version).</p>
<p>Semantic versioning is related to reproducibility because it helps us
specify flexible operating conditions. If packages follow Semver
strictly, all package constraints between A and B would be of the form
“A a.b.c requires B greater than x.y.z but less than w.0.0”^{Indeed,
<code>poetry add foo</code> adds a constraint on <code>foo</code> using
the newest version as x.y.z and sets w, quite sensibly, to x + 1.}. - x
represents the oldest public interface that A can tolerate; prior
versions would have the wrong interface. - y represents the oldest x
that has all the required functionality that A uses. Prior versions
would have the right interface but lack critical functionality. - z
represents the newest bug-fix in x.y that A requires. Prior versions
would have the right interface and functionality, but lack a bug-fix
that A depends on. - w is the oldest version of the public interface
that breaks A.</p>
<p>Flexible operating conditions are easier for the reproducer to
satisfy. They are also more likely to compose with the operating
conditions of other experiments without conflicting.</p>
<p>However, Semver is difficult to follow strictly in practice because
the package author may not know what is backwards-incompatible. Hyrum’s
law<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
states that “with a sufficient number of users of an API, all observable
behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.”</p>
<p>A facetious example is given in the following XKCD comic:</p>
<figure><img src="//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png" title="There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN." alt="Workflow" srcset="//imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow_2x.png 2x" style="image-orientation:none" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>The application developer thinks of their change as a bug fix, since
it prevents the CPU from overheating when the space bar is pressed.
However, this particular user thinks of the same change as
backwards-incompatible, since it breaks their workflow that depends
specifically on the CPU overheating when the space bar is pressed. A
real-world example of difference of opinion on what constitutes
backwards-compatibility comes from Python Cryptography when library
authors added a build-dependency on Rust. <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771#issuecomment-775861925" class="external-link">Library
authors</a> considered their change forwards-compatible, since the
public API did not change; however some sysadmins said this should have
been a <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5771#issuecomment-775038889" class="external-link">major
change</a>, since upgrading broke their systems.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);

    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
